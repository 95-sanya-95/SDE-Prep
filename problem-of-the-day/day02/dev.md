## Introduction to OOPS

Today, you should learn about **OOPS (Object Oriented Programming & System)**, which is a programming pattern/paradigm based on encapsulating data and functions in classes and objects.

It is necessary for most large scale software systems, and understanding it helps also understand how the language handles pointers and memory internally.
Many companies ask questions about OOPS in MCQ form and also sometimes in interviews about the harder concepts

To begin, follow [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_oop.asp) and read the *C++ Classes* from `C++ OOP` to `C++ Exceptions` 

For practice, you can use their inbuilt `Try it Yourself`

We'll cover more topics of OOPS in later weeks, so it is recommended you try to complete this short tutorial asap.
