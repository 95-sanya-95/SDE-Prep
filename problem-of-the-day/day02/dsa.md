# DSA Problem of the Day (28/05/2024)

## Binary Search and Implementation

Today, we will continue solving some problems on implementation. And learn about a new topic. ie Binary Search. Even if you are familiar with the topic, we have something for you too. Ever felt the constant guessing of +- 1 in binary search implementation, or stuck in an infinite loop for debugging. We provide a simple solution to these here.

To begin, follow [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) to solve the following problems. They will help you understand and practice key concepts in binary search:

1. [Number Spiral](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1071):- Implementation Problem. O(1) Time and Space Complexity.
2. [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/):- Try not guessing around +-1 conditions. See resources down below for help.
3. [Find first and last position of element in sorted array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/description/):- O(log(n)). Does there exist a inbuilt function to do this (Dont use it though).
4. [Valid Perfect Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-perfect-square/description/):- Dont use inbuilt sqrt function.
5. [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/)

## Resources

1. [Binary Search](https://cp-algorithms.com/num_methods/binary_search.html):- To understand what it is.
2. [Binary Search tutorial (C++ and Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU7DpgHINWQ):- To avoid infinite loops and stuff.

We'll cover more topics in DSA in the following weeks, so it is recommended you try to complete these problems as soon as possible.
