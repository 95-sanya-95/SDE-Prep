Knights and Knaves

A traveler meets a pair of twins at a fork in the road: one path is correct and one incorrect. 
One of the twins always tells the truth (knight), and the other one always lies (knave). 
Which single question can the traveler ask one of the twins to determine the correct path?

Hint: Ask one twin about the other twin'sÂ knowledge!
