# DSA Problem of the Day (27/05/2024)

## Implementation and Array Manipulation

Today, you should learn about  **Implementation and Array Manipulation** . These are fundamental concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) that are crucial for solving a wide range of problems efficiently.

Many companies ask questions about array manipulation and implementation techniques in coding interviews and online tests.

To begin, follow [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and solve the following problems. They will help you understand and practice key concepts in array manipulation:

1. [Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=mvdumf1t):- Try Implementing it in O(1) Space Complexity
2. [Elimination Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=mvdumf1t) :- Implement Recursive as well as Iterative Solution
3. [Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=mvdumf1t):- Can you do it in O(1) Time Complexity ?
4. [Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=mvdumf1t):- Can you do it in O(1) Time Complexity


We'll cover more topics in DSA in the following weeks, so it is recommended you try to complete these problems as soon as possible.

**Note:** We will be adding solutions to these problems in the upcoming days, so do check back regularly.
