Bullets of Fate

In a room stand N armed and angry people. At each chime of a clock, everyone simultaneously spins around and shoots a random other person. 
The persons shot fall dead and the survivors spin and shoot again at the next chime.
Eventually, either everyone is dead or there is a single survivor. As N grows, what is the limiting probability that there will be a survivor?
