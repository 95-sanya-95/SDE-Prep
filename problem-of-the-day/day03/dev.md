## Introduction to MultiThreading

Today, you should learn about **MultiThreading**, which is a programming technique which allows a process to execute multiple threads concurrently,
improving performance and responsiveness.    
The primary advantage of multithreading is parallelism, enabling tasks to run simultaneously, which reduces overall execution time.
For instance, in a web server, one thread can handle client requests while another processes data, leading to faster response times.
Similarly, in graphical user interfaces (GUIs), multithreading ensures that the interface remains responsive even when performing
time-consuming operations in the background.   
    
Multithreading is a vital concept in SDE interviews because it touches on various critical aspects of software development, 
including performance optimization, concurrency control, and system design.
Demonstrating a solid grasp of multithreading concepts and their practical applications can significantly enhance a candidate's prospects in technical interviews.   
    
To begin, Here's an excellent article for the Theory [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/multithreading).     
For implementation basics, You can try [PDF](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-api.pdf), or [Medium](https://medium.com/codex/c-multithreading-the-simple-way-95aa1f7304a2). Make sure to implement the code to get a solid grasp over the topic.   
Questions maybe asked directly from usage/implementation of various methods of pthread.

We'll cover more topics of Computer Architecture (including Multithreading) in later weeks, so it is recommended you try to complete this short tutorial asap.
